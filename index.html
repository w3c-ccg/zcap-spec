        Authorization Capabilities for Linked Data (<code>ZCAP-LD</code> for
        short) provides a
        secure way for linked data systems to grant and express authority
        utilizing the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-capability_model">
          object capability model</a>.
        Capabilities are represented as linked data objects which are signed
        with <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/ld-proofs/">
          Linked Data Proofs</a>.
        ZCAP-LD supports delegating authority to other entities
        on the network by chaining together capability documents.
        "Caveats" may be attached to capability documents which may be used to
        restrict the scope of their use, for example to restrict the actions
        which may be used or providing a mechanism by which the capability may
        be later revoked.

        This document is being based off of a
        <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rebooting-the-web-of-trust-fall2017/blob/master/draft-documents/lds-ocap/lds-ocap.md">paper from Rebooting Web of Trust</a>.

        This document does not cover a specific method for delivering ZCAP-LD
        invocations to an object, though something like the inbox property and
        associated delivery mechanisms from Linked Data Notifications and
        ActivityPub is one possible system.
        However there is nothing about ZCAP-LD that is specific to HTTP; for
        example, both capabilities and invocations could be stored on a
        blockchain or a distributed hash table.

        <h2>Capabilities vs. Access Control Lists</h2>
        <p>
          One of the first questions that is usually asked about using
          Object Capabilities for authorization is: "How are Capabilities
          different from Access Control Lists?". Fundamentally, Access Control
          Lists are about <em>authority by identity</em> whereas
          Object Capabilities are about <em>authority by possession</em>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Authority by identity is the process of giving access to a resource
          to a specific entity based on their identity. These processes
          typically ask the question: "Who are you?"
        </p>

        <p>
          Authority by possession is the process of giving access to a resource
          to any entity that possesses something, like a key. These processes
          typically ask the question: "Do you have a key that fits this lock?"
        </p>

        <p>
          This document doesn't explain why Access Control Lists lead to
          a variety of security issues or why Object Capabilities provide
          stronger security guarantees. For those that would like to
          learn more about these topics,
          <a href="http://srl.cs.jhu.edu/pubs/SRL2003-02.pdf">Capability Myths Demolished</a>

        <h2>ZCAP-LD by Example</h2>
        <p>
          Much of modern computing security infrastructure relies on "who is
          doing something" using access control lists.
          For example, our friend Alyssa P. Hacker has a car, and she would
          like to drive it
          In the access control list world, the car itself may scan Alyssa's
          face, determine that Alyssa is the driver, and say "Welcome Alyssa,
          you are now free to drive."
          Talking cars are appealing and fun, but Alyssa may run into
          challenges when she would like to allow others to drive her car.
        </p>

        <p>
          Fortunately, there is another paradigm that is even more familiar to
          the car scenario, but less familiar in the context of computing,
          despite providing some superior properties and a greater degree
          of safety: object capabilities.
          Object capabilities focus not on "who" is performing an action, but
          upon "what" source of authority permits an action to occur.
          As it turns out, Alyssa does not have a talking and face-scanning
          car, she has a car that accepts a car key.
          The car may have no memory of Alyssa whatsoever, but as long as
          Alyssa holds the kind of key that enables her to drive the car, she
          can drive the car.
          Capabilities are very similar to this car metaphor, and we can encode
          this same idea in ZCAP-LD.
          The following document delegates authority from the car (who always
          has authority over itself) to Alyssa so that she may drive:

        <p>
          Alyssa lives with her roommate and long-time friend Ben Bitdiddle.
          While they're living together, she'd like that he be able to drive
          her car too.
          Capabilities support delegation, so she could delegate a new
          capability to Ben giving him full authority, not unlike going to the
          hardware store and having them copy the car key.
          But Alyssa knows that she and Ben will probably not be roommates
          forever, and she feels no need for him to be able to drive her car
          once they are not, so she would like to have the option to revoke
          his authority.
          In the world of object capabilities, this is entirely possible by
          adding a "caveat" that permits future revocation.
          We can imagine this to be like a new car key that has a remote
          destruction mechanism: Alyssa can press a button that she has,
          a wire burns out inside the car key, and the car key will not be usable
          anymore.
          Alyssa generates a new capability document that points at the
          capability she has, adding the caveat:

        </pre>

        <p>
          Alyssa hands the car key to Ben, and Ben marks the car key in such
          a way that reminds him that it's specifically to drive Alyssa's car.
          Several months pass and Ben receives a message from Alyssa asking if
          he might enjoy joining her at an award ceremony her university is
          holding.
          Alyssa is already at the university and is getting a ride to the
          venue, so she suggests Ben drive her car and meet her there.
          Ben invokes his capability, the car performs all relevant checks on
          the capability (including that the proof/signature is valid and applicable,
          and that the caveat is still valid), and off Ben drives.
        </p>

        <p>
          Ben arrives at the fancy award venue, where there is valet parking.
          The Valet approaches wearing the nametag "Lem E. Driveit" and asks
          for a key to park the car.
          Ben remembers he has heard some stories about valets going on
          joyrides and isn't sure if they're true, but decides there's no need
          to take the risk: he can use his capability to create a new, further
          restricted capability which he can delegate to Lem.
          This new car key has the caveat that it can be used to drive up
          to 5 kilometers, but no more:

       {"type": "DriveNoMoreThan",
        // Alyssa's gauge currently says 123854 kilometers driven,
        // so this is only 5 km more than the current value

        </pre>

        <p>
          (It probably doesn't matter to this scenario, but since it is derived
          from the car key that Ben holds, it also has the same caveat that it
          will also be remote destructed by Alyssa along with Ben's car key
          should she press the relevant button.)

        <h2>Capabilities Are Safer</h2>
        <p>
          We can see from the above example that by using an object capability
          system such as ZCAP-LD can give us some additional
          power around delegating and restricting the scope of capabilities.
          But object capabilities provide improved safety characteristics
          over Access Control Lists which may make them frequently better
          choices (for more details, see the paper
          <a href="http://waterken.sourceforge.net/aclsdont/current.pdf">
            ACLs Don't</a>).
          Object capability systems are in general more robust against:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Ambient authority problems:</b>
            For example, in an access control list environment,
            if an attacker gets you to open a message in your email client
            which contains an image which triggers an arbitrary code execution
            vulnerability in the image library it is using, an attacker can
            use this to do everything that you can: read or destroy your
            documents, they can run programs as you, and they can in general
            do anything that you can... all from a pin-prick sized vulnerability.
            Properly using an object capability environment, the worst an
            attacker could do is mess with your email (or if the program is
            itself capability aware, they may not be able to do even
            that... they could just display some nasty imagery on your screen,
            which they could do already anyway).
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Confused deputy attacks:</b>
            For example, browsers and both backend and frontend software for
            the web have frequently struggled with Cross-Site Request Forgery
            attack issues.
            Your browser may both allow you websites to access resources on
            other websites and also allow you to log into various websites,
            say a social networking site or a bank.
            A malicious website could use this to its advantage to trick
            your browser into performing actions as you on those other sites...
            say to read from or spam to your social timeline, or to withdraw
            money from your bank account.
            While various techniques to can be used to restrict the scope
            of these attacks, they are notoriously hard to prevent.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Object capabilities are less vulnerable to these kinds of attacks
          because capabilities are an encoding of "the principle of least
          authority" in software development practice.
          ZCAP-LD helps bring the power of capabilities to the web, providing
          specific and directed grants of authority.

      <h2>Capabilities</h2>

      <p>
        ZCAP-LD capabilities are encoded through a chain of linked data
        documents, granting authority to a target, possibly restricted through
        "caveats".
        Authority starts with the target (which always has authority to invoke
        itself) and extends to further <code>invoker</code> entities along
        the chain.
        Each capability document granting authority must be signed off with a
        proof by an entity which has previously been granted authority on the
        chain.
        Any caveat applied by a parent in the chain applies to its descendants.
      </p>

      <div class="note">
        <p>
          The target's json-ld document is a kind of "special" capability document
          implicitly granting authority to itself.
          But why?
          Surely in most protocols, such as when objects are sending
          invocations over HTTP POST requests, any target that wants to
          self-modify could do so internally without an explicit invocation
          process.
          But in some systems such as blockchains, there is no "internal" state,
          so explicitly doing an invocation to change behavior is still useful.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another reason is that it simplifies the invocation algorithm: as we
          delegate authority to the first non-target entity, we do so using the
          target's cryptographic authority.
          If this authority can be used to grant capabilities, it may as well
          be able to be used to invoke them as well.
        </p>
      </div>

          cryptographic material (such as public keys) being granted authority
          to use this capability
        </li>
      </ul>

      <div class="note">
        <p>
          Why don't all child capabilities require a invoker property?
          The reason is that it is perfectly reasonable for an entity which has
          authority to a capability to give an attenuated capability to
          <em>itself</em> to be used in a specific context.
        </p>
        <p>
          Capabilities are not structured around "who has access" to something
          but rather holding onto a capability for a particular use, and in
          order to avoid confused deputy and ambient authority problems,
          in general objects should not hold on to a "bucket" of capabilities
          which grant them authority, but hold on to them within specific
          contexts for specific purposes.
          In general, when an object is granted a capability, it is important
          that it know for what specific purpose it has been granted that
          capability so that it does not become confused and use it in the
          wrong scenario.
          This is not unlike how in computer programs a procedure called with
          specific arguments understands for what the meaning of those arguments
          are and for what they may be used.

      <h2>Invocation</h2>

      <p>
        A capability may be enacted through the process of invocation.
        In the context of ZCAP-LD, an invocation consists of a linked data
        object which MUST have a <code>proof</code> property with a value
        containing:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          a <code>proofPurpose</code> of <code>capabilityInvocation</code>
        </li>
        <li>
          a <code>capability</code> property which links to the
          capability document that grants authority to invoke this capability
        </li>
        <li>
          the proof must validate against cryptographic material
          granted authority by the <code>invoker</code> field from the
          capability chain.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        An invocation SHOULD have an <code>id</code> (which may also serve as a
        nonce).
        Any other properties are considered arguments to the invocation.
      </p>

      <p>
        Each capability document accrues granted authority in the chain, which
        is used to both authorize further capability delegation and may be used
        to invoke the capability chain.
        The capability document that is invoked's chain is recursively traversed
        up along the <code>previousCapability</code> document until the target is
        found (the root document that has no <code>previousCapability</code>
        property).
        The target's <code>capabilityDelegation</code> cryptographic material is
        marked in the initial set of authority.
        The capability chain is then traversed from this root target back down
        through each delegated capability all the way to the invoked capability
        document leaf, validating and accruing authority:
      </p>

      <li>
        <ul>
          The <code>proof</code> field of this capability document is checked for a
          valid proof with a <code>proofPurpose</code> of
          <code>capabilityDelegation</code> where the <code>creator</code> of the
          proof is cryptographic material in the currently authorized set.
        </ul>
        <ul>
          The caveats of this capability document are checked for validity.
        </ul>
        <ul>
          The cryptographic material on the <code>invoker</code> field is added
          to the currently authorized set.
        </ul>
        <ul>
          We traverse to the next document downwards towards the leaf, repeating
          this process until we are back at the leaf again.
        </ul>
      </li>

      <p>
        At this point, the invocation is considered valid and any relevant
        action may be performed.
        (This does not guarantee that a specific result will occur, merely that
        the invocation itself is valid; a invocationTarget could in evaluating
        the invocation encounter invalid input and return or raise an error,
        for instance.)
      </p>

      <div class="note">
        <p>
          Since invocations are themselves linked data documents, it is
          possible for an invocation to refer to an invocation as an argument.
          For this reason it is critical that mechanisms for accepting
          invocations be sure which invocation is being performed.
          For example, a mechanism that accepts ZCAP-LD capabilities as
          JSON-LD documents will likely have no trouble telling which
          invocation is being performed since that will be the "top"
          of the framed document.
          However, a mechanism which accepted N-Quads would need additional
          information supplied perhaps in the headers in order to be able
          to determine the "root" of the invocation.

      <section id="actions">
        <h2>Actions</h2>

        <p>
          Actions are a common way to direct behavior of an invocation.
          Targets are free to choose their own mechanisms for directing
          behavior, but MAY support the <code>action</code> property on
          invocations as one common behavioral direction technique.
          The <code>action</code> property points to a URI as a form of
          vocabulary to determine which action is being performed.
          For example, a capability to a file storage system may allow
          for both reading and writing files, and a user could choose
          to set the <code>action</code> to
          <code>https://datastore.example/WriteFile</code>
          as an argument on their invocation.

      <h2>Relationship to Verifiable Credentials</h2>

      <p>
        The
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/verifiable-claims-data-model/">
          Verifiable Credentials Data Model</a>
        provides a powerful vocabulary for correlating information and
        presenting correlated information in a secure way.
        This can be used to make claims about some subject, to present
        credential certifying you are qualified to do some thing, or so on.
        This is useful for gathering and presenting information that can
        be reasoned about.
        Indeed, this maps nicely to "the real world", as humans tend to be
        "correlation/reasoning machines".
        For example, Eva Lu Ator is hoping to hire a system administrator and
        may check for a college diploma, past work history, or recommendations
        from known entities considered qualified to judge competency to fulfill
        the role, and all of these can be modeled nicely with the Verifiable
        Credentials Data Model.
      </p>

      <p>
        Thus it may be tempting to design a system in which a credential
        is presented in order to permit or forbid access to some resource.
        Unfortunately, associating "who is authorized to do what" leads us back
        to all the problems of access control lists,
        <a href="capabilities-are-safer">which we would like to avoid</a>.
        When returning to our hiring a system administrator example it is
        easy to imagine how, upon hiring Alice as as a system administrator,
        Eva would hand Alice a capability to begin administrating her systems.
        But in considering the previous step where Eva contemplates
        <i>whether or not to hand Alice that capability</i>
        seems to pull us right back to correlating information about Alice's
        identity.
        (What is Alice's educational background?  What is Alice's prior work
        experience?)
      </p>

      <p>
        We seem to be in a conundrum.
        Claims and credentials are forms of correlation that allow us to reason
        about an entity in our squishy human world, but are unsafe when used as
        mechanisms to authorize some event to occur within a system.
        Capabilities are a safe mechanism to model the flow of authority through
        a system, but there are times when capabilities have not been granted
        and we need to make a "judgement call" by correlating information about
        that entity.
        What should we do?
      </p>

      <p>
        To pose the question is to see the answer: the right approach is to use
        each system for what it does best.
        Use correlation (Verifiable Credentials) in a reasoning system (most
        commonly human reasoning) as a path to make judgements about whether to
        hand an entity a specific set of initial capabilities.
        Use capabilities (ZCAP-LD) as the mechanism to grant and exercise
        authority through computing systems.
        To return to our system administrator example, when Alice applies for the
        job, she submits a series of credentials about her prior work history
        and degree, and Eva is able to verify that it is Alice's former
        employers and university which have made these claims.
        Deciding that Alice is fit for the job, Eva hands Alice her initial
        capability which grants her authority to administrate the systems in
        question (with a caveat that allows Eva to revoke that authority at a
        future date, if appropriate).
        Alice uses that capability as the initial entry point into
        administrating the system.

    <section class="appendix informative" id="handling-abuse">
      <h2>Handling abuse</h2>

      <p>
        The previous section discussed cases in which correlation (particularly
        through Verifiable Credentials) is used to grant an initial set of
        capabilities.
        This section discusses how correlation may be used to revoke
        capabilities under certain circumstances, and steps that should be
        taken to ensure this is done safely.
      </p>

      <p>
        Capability systems focus on what authority grants that an operation may
        be performed, not on who is performing the action.
        In some object capability systems (such as many object capability
        programming languages) it is not even possible to see what entity is
        invoking a capability.
        In the case of ZCAP-LD, it is always possible to inspect an invocation
        to check which authentication material authorized to invoke the
        capability is being used in the invocation, and this may permit
        checking a certain amount of "who" is performing the action, but to
        focus on the "who" rather than the source of authority would
        <a href="capabilities-are-safer">
          bring us back to the dangers of Access Control Lists</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Nonetheless, there comes a time when correlating information about
        usage of a resource becomes critical, and this is in mitigating abuse.
        Even traditional capability systems, in developing solutions to this
        problem, develop techniques for correlating information about "who"
        has performed an action.
        (For example,
        <a href="http://www.erights.org/elib/capability/horton/">Horton</a>
        is one such system for E, though as previously stated,
        such information can be cleaned already by looking at the invocation
        and capability chain documents in ZCAP-LD.)
        The key to permit detecting and mitigating abuse safely in a capability
        based environment is to treat correlation of who is using a service
        not as something that is used per-invocation, but as something to be
        reasoned about to possibly revoke authority.
        (Astute readers may observe that between the previous section and this
        section we have defined safe ways to use correlation in conjunction
        with capabilities: as the entry point and possible termination point,
        with capabilities powering the machine in-between.)
      </p>

      <p>
        For example, Alice has granted capabilities (with caveats that permit
        revocation) to a number of users access to run programs on the systems
        she is administrating, but someone is using their capability to abuse
        the system.
        The system itself performs the invocations as the users call them,
        but Alice, or a program Alice runs, is able to analyze a log of past
        invocations called.
        Having finished the analysis, Alice realizes that the abuse is coming
        from the invocation of a capability granted to some of Mallet's
        authentication material, and Alyssa revokes that capability.
